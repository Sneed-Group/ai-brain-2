# AI Brain 2

Codenamed "Project GLaDOS 2" - this is a library for a near-perfect high-level recreation of the human brain - powered by Ollama and Javascript.

This is what I like to call "Brain HLE" or "Brain High-Level Emulation." It's like the HLE technique to create game emulators - but for the mind.
