# AI Brain 2

Codenamed "Project GLaDOS 2" - this is a library for a near-perfect high-level recreation of the human brain - powered by Ollama and Javascript.

Now an actual high-level inerpteration of a brain and not some B-tier "oh i am at *random place* doing *random thing*" crap. (AGI?)

This is what I like to call "Brain HLE" or "Brain High-Level Emulation." It's like the HLE technique to create game emulators - but for the mind.


This will start off as a simple library for building basic AGI apps - but then expand out to other fields.
